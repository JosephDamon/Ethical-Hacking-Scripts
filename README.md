# Ethical-Hacking-Scripts

Welcome to my `Ethical-Hacking-Scripts` repository! This collection is dedicated to providing cybersecurity professionals, network administrators, and IT enthusiasts with a suite of scripts and tools designed to enhance various aspects of ethical hacking and network security analysis.

## Current Tools

### detailed_scan.sh

`detailed_scan.sh` is a Bash script that optimizes `nmap` network scans for efficiency and readability. It employs a two-phase scanning approach, initially conducting a rapid scan to identify open ports, followed by a detailed `-A` scan on those ports. The script enhances output readability by color-coding port numbers and service names, aiding in the quick identification of critical information. Ideal for streamlining network analysis tasks, `detailed_scan.sh` is the first of many tools I aim to provide for the security community.

## Usage

Each script in this repository has its own specific usage instructions. Please refer to the individual script documentation for detailed information. For example, to use `detailed_scan.sh`:

```bash
./detailed_scan.sh <target-ip-or-hostname>
```
