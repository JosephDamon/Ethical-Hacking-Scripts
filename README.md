# Ethical-Hacking-Scripts

Welcome to my `Ethical-Hacking-Scripts` repository! This collection is dedicated to providing cybersecurity professionals, network administrators, and IT enthusiasts with a suite of scripts and tools designed to enhance various aspects of ethical hacking and network security analysis.

## Current Tools

### detailed_scan.sh

`detailed_scan.sh` is a Bash script that optimizes `nmap` network scans for efficiency and readability. It employs a two-phase scanning approach, initially conducting a rapid scan to identify open ports, followed by a detailed `-A` scan on those ports. The script enhances output readability by color-coding port numbers and service names, aiding in the quick identification of critical information. Ideal for streamlining network analysis tasks, `detailed_scan.sh` is the first of many tools we aim to provide for the security community.

## Future Additions

The `Ethical-Hacking-Scripts` repository is expected to grow, incorporating a variety of scripts and tools that cover different aspects of ethical hacking. Stay tuned for updates and new additions that will further aid in network analysis, penetration testing, and security auditing.

## Usage

Each script in this repository has its own specific usage instructions. Please refer to the individual script documentation for detailed information. For example, to use `detailed_scan.sh`:

```bash
./detailed_scan.sh <target-ip-or-hostname>
